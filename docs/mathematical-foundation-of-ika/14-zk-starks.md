# zk-STARKs ‚Üí Transparent & Post-Quantum ZK Proofs

In Part 13, we saw how pairing-based zk-SNARKs enable succinct proofs but require a trusted setup and rely on elliptic curves (not post-quantum safe). Now we move to **zk-STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge)**, which achieve:

-   Transparency (no trusted setup)
-   Post-quantum security (only hashes & finite fields)
-   Scalability for massive computations

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why zk-STARKs?

Problems with SNARKs:

-   Need trusted setup (toxic waste risk)
-   Pairing-based crypto not post-quantum
-   Complex algebra ‚Üí harder to audit

STARKs solve this with:

-   Only hash functions (Merkle trees, FRI)
-   Information-theoretic soundness
-   Post-quantum safety

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Ideas of STARKs

STARK = Interactive Oracle Proof (IOP) over a finite field. Key components:

-   **Arithmetization**: Represent computation as polynomial constraints.
-   **Low-Degree Testing (LDT)**: Verify polynomials are low-degree.
-   **FRI Protocol**: Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof for LDT.
-   **Hash commitments**: Merkle proofs for transparency.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Arithmetization

Convert program/circuit ‚Üí algebraic constraints:

-   **Execution trace**: Sequence of states
-   **Constraints**: Polynomials satisfied by valid trace

So verifying a computation reduces to checking:

```

P(x) = 0 \quad \forall x ‚àà Domain

```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Low-Degree Testing

Verifier needs to check: ‚ÄúIs `P(x)` a low-degree polynomial?‚Äù without reading all values.

-   Uses random sampling ‚Üí only need a few queries
-   Rejects with high probability if cheating.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ FRI Protocol (Fast Reed-Solomon IOP)

FRI = proof that a function is close to low-degree. Process:

-   Commit to polynomial evaluations via Merkle tree
-   Randomly fold polynomial ‚Üí halve domain each round
-   After `log(n)` steps, get tiny polynomial ‚Üí easy to check

FRI ‚Üí logarithmic proof size.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ STARK Proof Flow

-   Prover computes execution trace
-   Encodes trace as polynomial `P(x)`
-   Uses Merkle + FRI to prove `P(x)` satisfies constraints
-   Verifier queries small random subset ‚Üí high confidence

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ STARK Properties

-   ‚úÖ **Transparent**: No trusted setup
-   ‚úÖ **Post-quantum**: Uses only hashes
-   ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Proof size ~ `O(log¬≤ n)`
-   ‚úÖ **Fast verifier**: Sublinear time

But:

-   Proof size bigger than SNARKs (~50‚Äì200KB vs ~200B)

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Where zk-STARKs Are Used

-   **StarkNet**: Ethereum L2 zk-rollup
-   **zkSync**: STARK variant
-   **Cairo VM**: Provable virtual machine

They allow verifiable execution of entire programs.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ SNARKs vs STARKs

| Feature           | SNARK (Groth16) | STARK       |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Trusted Setup** | ‚úÖ Required     | ‚ùå None     |
| **Proof Size**    | ~200 bytes      | ~50KB       |
| **Verification**  | Constant        | Logarithmic |
| **Crypto Base**   | Pairings        | Hashes      |
| **Post-Quantum**  | ‚ùå No           | ‚úÖ Yes      |

So:

-   SNARKs = smaller proof, trusted setup
-   STARKs = transparent, bigger proof

---

## 10Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Quantum Security

Since STARKs rely only on:

-   Merkle trees (hash functions)
-   Low-degree polynomial tests

They resist quantum attacks unlike pairing-based SNARKs.

---

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ STARKs in MPC & Privacy

-   Can prove MPC results succinctly
-   Can verify correctness of large computations in public blockchain
-   Enable zk-rollups, privacy DeFi

---

## 12Ô∏è‚É£ Mathematical Recap

-   **FRI folding**:

```

f'(x) = \frac{f(x)+f(Œ±x)}{2}

```

-   **STARK verification**:
    -   Commit ‚Üí Merkle tree
    -   Random queries ‚Üí low-degree test
    -   Hash ‚Üí Fiat-Shamir to make NIZK

## üîó How It Leads Forward

Now we have transparent, scalable ZKPs (STARKs). Next, we‚Äôll combine SNARKs, STARKs, MPC, HE, commitments into **composable cryptographic protocols**‚Äîhow they‚Äôre layered in real-world systems (wallets, bridges, cross-chain MPC).

---

## ‚úÖ Next in Part 15

We‚Äôll explore Composable Cryptographic Protocols:

-   How SNARKs, commitments, MPC, HE combine
-   Privacy coins, threshold wallets
-   Cross-chain bridges security
