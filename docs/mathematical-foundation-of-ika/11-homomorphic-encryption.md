# Homomorphic Encryption ‚Üí Paillier Scheme ‚Üí Computing on Encrypted Data

In Part 10, we saw MPC via secret sharing & garbled circuits. Now we explore another powerful tool: **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**, which allows computing directly on ciphertexts without decrypting them. This is key for:

-   Privacy-preserving computation
-   MPC without heavy interaction
-   Threshold cryptography

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Homomorphic Encryption?

A cryptosystem `Enc, Dec` is homomorphic if:

```

Enc(m‚ÇÅ) ‚äó Enc(m‚ÇÇ) = Enc(m‚ÇÅ ‚äï m‚ÇÇ)

```

Where `‚äó` is some operation on ciphertexts, and `‚äï` is the corresponding plaintext operation.

### Types of Homomorphism

-   **Additive homomorphic** ‚Üí `Enc(m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ)` computable
-   **Multiplicative homomorphic** ‚Üí `Enc(m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ)` computable
-   **Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)** ‚Üí any function `f(m)` computable

For MPC, even partial homomorphism is useful.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Paillier Cryptosystem (Additive Homomorphism)

Paillier (1999) is a classic additively homomorphic encryption scheme:

### Keygen

-   Choose large primes `p,q`
-   `n = pq`, `Œª = lcm(p-1,q-1)`
-   Pick `g ‚àà ‚Ñ§‚Çô¬≤*`
-   Public key: `(n,g)`, secret key: `Œª`

### Encryption

To encrypt `m ‚àà ‚Ñ§‚Çô`:

```

Enc(m; r) = g^m ¬∑ r^n \bmod n¬≤

```

where `r` is random.

### Decryption

```

m = \frac{L(c^Œª \bmod n¬≤)}{L(g^Œª \bmod n¬≤)} \bmod n, \quad L(u)=\frac{u-1}{n}

```

### Additive Homomorphism

```

Enc(m‚ÇÅ)¬∑Enc(m‚ÇÇ) = g^{m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ} (r‚ÇÅr‚ÇÇ)^n = Enc(m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ)

```

So you can add plaintexts by multiplying ciphertexts.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multiplicative Homomorphic Examples

ElGamal encryption over group `G` is multiplicatively homomorphic:

```

Enc(m‚ÇÅ) ‚äó Enc(m‚ÇÇ) = Enc(m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ)

```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why Useful in MPC?

Homomorphic encryption allows offloading computation:

-   Parties encrypt inputs ‚Üí aggregator computes on ciphertexts ‚Üí decrypt result.

Example:

-   **Voting**: Each vote `Enc(v)`, server multiplies all votes ‚Üí sum of plaintexts.
-   **Private machine learning**: Compute on encrypted data.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ HE + Secret Sharing Hybrid

-   HE for addition
-   Beaver triples for multiplication
-   Hybrid = efficient MPC without full FHE complexity.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

Craig Gentry (2009) gave first FHE scheme:

-   Supports arbitrary circuits
-   Heavy computational cost, but improving
-   FHE allows MPC with minimal interaction.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Homomorphic Commitments

Similar to HE, Pedersen commitments are additively homomorphic:

```

Com(m‚ÇÅ)¬∑Com(m‚ÇÇ)=Com(m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ)

```

This duality (commitments ‚Üî HE) shows same group properties drive both.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ MPC Use Cases of HE

-   **Threshold ECDSA**: Paillier for homomorphic addition of key shares
-   **Voting**: Homomorphic tallying
-   **Private DeFi analytics**: Aggregate encrypted balances
-   DWallet-like systems often combine Paillier + MPC.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Mathematical Representation Recap

-   **Paillier encryption**:

```

Enc(m) = g^m r^n \mod n¬≤

```

-   **Additive homomorphism**:

```

Enc(m‚ÇÅ)¬∑Enc(m‚ÇÇ) = Enc(m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ)

```

-   **ElGamal multiplicative**:

```

Enc(m‚ÇÅ)¬∑Enc(m‚ÇÇ)=Enc(m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ)

```
