## Main theoretical foundation of the Euclidean Division Algorithm

At its core, the algorithm rests on two simple but powerful facts about integers:

1. **Measurement principle** (Euclid‚Äôs idea):
   Any positive integer $a$ can be ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù by another positive integer $b$.
   If you subtract multiples of $b$ from $a$, eventually you reach a leftover that is smaller than $b$.
   This leftover is the **remainder**.

2. **Well-ordering principle**:
   The set of nonnegative integers has a least element.
   So when we look for the ‚Äúsmallest nonnegative remainder‚Äù after subtracting multiples of $b$, it must exist.

3. **Uniqueness property**:
   If there were two different representations of $a$:

    $$
    a = bq_1 + r_1 = bq_2 + r_2, \quad 0 \leq r_1, r_2 < b
    $$

    then subtracting gives $b(q_1 - q_2) = r_2 - r_1$.
    But the right-hand side is smaller than $b$ in absolute value, which is only possible if it is zero.
    Hence $q_1 = q_2$ and $r_1 = r_2$.

So the **foundation** can be summarized:

-   **Existence** of a quotient and remainder comes from repeated subtraction and the well-ordering principle.
-   **Uniqueness** comes from the boundedness condition $0 \leq r < b$.

üëâ In short:
The Euclidean Division Algorithm is founded on the idea that integers can always be decomposed uniquely into multiples of a divisor plus a remainder, guaranteed by the discreteness and order structure of the integers.

## How Euclid might have discovered it

-   **Geometric mindset**:
    Euclid didn‚Äôt think in algebraic symbols. Numbers were ‚Äúmagnitudes‚Äù (lengths of line segments) that could be compared and measured.

-   **Measuring process**:
    To divide $a$ by $b$, imagine laying out copies of $b$ along a line segment of length $a$.

    -   Count how many times $b$ fits completely ‚Äî that‚Äôs the **quotient**.
    -   Whatever part of $a$ remains at the end ‚Äî shorter than one copy of $b$ ‚Äî is the **remainder**.

-   **Observation of termination**:
    Since the leftover must always be smaller than $b$, the process naturally ends.
    This gave him the existence of quotient and remainder.

-   **Implicit uniqueness**:
    Euclid probably reasoned intuitively that the number of times $b$ can be ‚Äúlaid out‚Äù inside $a$ is fixed ‚Äî you can‚Äôt have two different counts that both work. That‚Äôs the uniqueness property in geometric form.

‚ú® So in Euclid‚Äôs world, the Division Algorithm wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äútheorem with symbols.‚Äù
It was a **practical procedure of measurement**:

-   Fit one line segment into another repeatedly.
-   Count the fits (quotient).
-   Take what‚Äôs left over (remainder).

Later mathematicians formalized this into the precise statement of the **Division Theorem**.
