## Main theoretical foundation of the Euclidean algorithm:

If a number divides two integers, it also divides their difference.
If a number divides two integers, it also divides their difference.

That’s Proposition VII.1 in Euclid’s Elements. From that one property, the entire GCD algorithm flows.

### Requirements (why it works)

1. Integers only: The theory depends on integers being closed under subtraction.

2. Divisibility is preserved: If
   𝑑
   ∣
   𝑎
   d∣a and
   𝑑
   ∣
   𝑏
   d∣b, then
   𝑑
   ∣
   (
   𝑎
   −
   𝑏
   )
   d∣(a−b).

3. Well-ordering principle: Positive integers have a least element. This ensures the process terminates — eventually the subtraction chain reaches the GCD.

So there’s no “extra requirement” other than working in the integers.

## How Euclid might have discovered it

We can’t know exactly how Euclid thought, but historians reconstruct something like this:

In ancient Greek math, they didn’t have “modulo” or algebraic notation. They reasoned with ratios and geometric magnitudes.

Suppose you want to compare two lengths (say of sticks or line segments). The Greeks would ask: What is the greatest common measure of these lengths?

If one line is longer, subtract the shorter repeatedly until you can’t anymore. The leftover is the “remainder.”

If something measures both lengths, it must measure the remainder too. So the problem reduces.

Repeat until nothing remains — the last measure is the greatest common divisor.

That’s essentially the Euclidean algorithm by subtraction.

## Gauss’s role

Gauss (in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, 1801) introduced the congruence notation we now use:

𝑎
≡
𝑏
(
m
o
d
𝑛
)
a≡b(modn)

That compressed Euclid’s subtractive reasoning into a single modern operation: “the remainder modulo
𝑛
n.”

Euclid gave the idea (divisibility + repeated subtraction).

Gauss gave the language (congruences, modular arithmetic).

## Definition:

The greatest common divisor
𝑔
=
gcd
⁡
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
g=gcd(a,b) is the largest integer that divides both
𝑎
a and
𝑏
b.

### Key Insight from Division Theorem:

If

# 𝑎

𝑏
𝑞

-   𝑟
    a=bq+r

then any divisor of
𝑎
a and
𝑏
b also divides
𝑟
r.
So,

gcd
⁡
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
=
gcd
⁡
(
𝑏
,
𝑟
)
gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,r)

This gives the Euclidean Algorithm:
Repeatedly replace
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
(a,b) with
(
𝑏
,
𝑟
)
(b,r) until
𝑟
=
0
r=0. Then,
gcd
⁡
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
=
𝑏
gcd(a,b)=b.
