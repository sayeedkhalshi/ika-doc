# Elliptic Curve Mathematics → ECC Groups → Stronger Discrete Log Security

Part 6 showed us how prime-order groups over integers modulo `p` powered classical cryptographic systems like Diffie-Hellman. But those systems carry a heavy cost: massive key sizes. Enter Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), where the same security strength fits into a fraction of the space. But ECC isn't just compact — it's harder to break, thanks to the unique shape of its mathematics.

## What Is an Elliptic Curve?

An elliptic curve is defined by the Weierstrass equation:

```

y² = x³ + ax + b

```

over a field `F` (ℝ, GF(p), etc.), with one crucial condition:

```

4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0   (no singularities)

```

This ensures the curve is smooth — no cusps, no intersections, no dead zones. It includes all `(x, y)` pairs that satisfy the equation, plus a special point at infinity `𝒪`.

### Over Finite Fields

In cryptography, we work in `GF(p)` — integers mod a prime `p`:

```

E(𝔽\_p) = { (x, y) ∈ 𝔽\_p | y² = x³ + ax + b } ∪ {𝒪}

```

The result is a finite abelian group, usually with close to `p` points. This group isn’t just algebra — it’s the battlefield for elliptic curve cryptography.

## Group Law on Elliptic Curves

Elliptic curves define a group, but the addition looks nothing like integer addition. It’s geometric.

To add `P + Q`:

-   Draw the line through `P` and `Q`.
-   That line intersects the curve at a third point `R`.
-   Reflect `R` across the x-axis — that’s `P + Q`.

To double a point `P`:

-   Take the tangent line at `P`.
-   Find its intersection with the curve: `R`.
-   Reflect it. That’s `2P`.

### Algebraic Form

Given `P = (x₁, y₁)`, `Q = (x₂, y₂)`, define the slope `λ`:

```

λ = {
(y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)      if P ≠ Q
(3x₁² + a)/(2y₁)         if P = Q
}

```

Then compute:

```

x₃ = λ² - x₁ - x₂
y₃ = λ(x₁ - x₃) - y₁

```

So `(x₃, y₃) = P + Q`. In finite fields, all of this is done modulo `p`.

## Why Is It a Group?

Elliptic curves over finite fields form abelian groups. Here's why:

-   **Closure**: Adding two points gives another valid point.
-   **Associativity**: `(P + Q) + R = P + (Q + R)`
-   **Identity**: `𝒪`, the point at infinity, behaves like zero: `P + 𝒪 = P`.
-   **Inverses**: Each point `P` has a reflection `-P` such that `P + (-P) = 𝒪`.

These properties aren't just formalism. They're what make ECC viable as a cryptographic platform.

## Scalar Multiplication

Elliptic curve cryptography revolves around **scalar multiplication**:

```

kP = P + P + ... + P   (k times)

```

It’s asymmetric:

-   **Easy direction**: Given `k`, compute `kP` quickly via double-and-add. Time: `O(log k)`.
-   **Hard direction**: Given `P` and `kP`, recover `k`. That’s the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**.

This asymmetry is the backbone of ECC.

## Why ECDLP Is Harder

Discrete log problems over integers mod `p` can be attacked with subexponential algorithms like Index Calculus.

ECDLP? No such luck.

The best known method — Pollard’s Rho — runs in `O(√n)`, which is exponential in the bit-length of the group order. No shortcuts. No known structure to exploit.

The implications:

-   A **256-bit ECC key** offers the same security as a **3072-bit RSA key**.
-   Smaller bandwidth, faster operations, same strength.

ECC isn't just a clever alternative — it's a leap in efficiency and hardness.

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

ECC builds protocols on top of scalar multiplication and ECDLP:

-   **ECDH**: Alice computes `aG`, Bob computes `bG`, shared key = `abG`.
-   **ECDSA**: A digital signature scheme using the hardness of ECDLP.
-   **EdDSA**: A modern variant built on Edwards curves, safer and faster.

These aren't just academic — they run the internet, the blockchain, and privacy networks.

## Prime-Order Subgroups in ECC

Not every elliptic curve group is clean. Some have composite order:

```

|E(𝔽\_p)| = h · q

```

Here, `q` is a large prime, and `h` is the **cofactor**. We work inside the prime-order subgroup of size `q` to avoid vulnerabilities like small subgroup confinement or invalid curve attacks.

Good cryptographic curves ensure `h` is small — often 1 or 8 — so the subgroup structure is tight and clean.

## Popular Curves

Each curve is engineered for a reason:

-   **secp256k1**: Bitcoin’s curve. Fast, but minimal side-channel defenses.
-   **P-256**: A NIST standard. Conservative, slow, but vetted.
-   **Ed25519**: Built on a twisted Edwards curve. Fast, safe, modern.
-   **BLS12-381**: Designed for pairing-based protocols like zk-SNARKs.

No single curve dominates. Each reflects a choice — performance, security, legacy, or compatibility.

## Why ECC Changed the Game

-   **Compact keys**: Leaner bandwidth, faster performance.
-   **Tighter hardness**: ECDLP resists all known attacks — except quantum.
-   **Versatility**: Works with advanced constructions — pairings, zero-knowledge, threshold schemes.

Without ECC, modern cryptography would buckle under the weight of key sizes and compute time.

## What This Unlocks

We now have two major group platforms:

-   Integer groups mod `p`
-   Elliptic curve groups over `GF(p)`

Both power cryptography. But ECC expands the playbook. Next comes a new direction — **commitments**, **secret sharing**, and **homomorphisms** — that transform how multiple parties compute together and prove things in zero-knowledge.

## Up Next in Part 8

We dive into Commitment Schemes and Secret Sharing:

-   **Shamir’s Secret Sharing**: Splitting secrets with polynomials.
-   **Pedersen Commitments**: Hiding values while keeping algebra.
-   **Homomorphic Groups**: Building blocks for MPC and zero-knowledge proofs.

This is where cryptography moves from individual keys to collective computation.
